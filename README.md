# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project involves detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset contains features such as transaction amount, user information, and time of transaction, with the target variable indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

### Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing the data to ensure it's ready for machine learning models.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features that improve the model's predictive power.
- **Model Building**: Using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict fraudulent transactions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

### Files:
- **`Credit Card fraud Detection.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook where the data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation are performed.
- **`credit_card_fraud.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model, which contains transaction details and labels (fraudulent or not).

### Installation and Setup:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanshika161/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   Use the following command to install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**:
   - Open the `Credit Card fraud Detection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Execute the cells to load the dataset, preprocess it, train the machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

### How to Use:
1. Load the `credit_card_fraud.csv` dataset into the notebook.
2. Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
3. Train various classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. Evaluate the models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. Use the best-performing model to predict fraudulent transactions.

### Testing:
The notebook is set up to test the trained model on a test set from the dataset. You can modify the dataset to include more features or apply different preprocessing techniques to improve the model's performance.

### Project Structure:
- **`Credit Card fraud Detection.ipynb`**: Contains the Python code for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- **`credit_card_fraud.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models.
